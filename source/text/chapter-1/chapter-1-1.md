## First Bowl: Serving Attitude

 Let us begin with the first of the seven bowls – the fundamental intent. This is about making a choice: Will we embrace a humble attitude of service, or will we seek to dominate and rule? In an environment of hardship, where we know nothing else and react solely to what surrounds us, dominance may seem like the obvious choice. It promises control, power, and survival. But if our goal is to discover and grow in love, dominance is the least useful path. It builds walls, not bridges. Humble service, on the other hand, is far more challenging in such an environment. It requires us to question our reality and seek something greater, something deeper than the physical world we see. It asks us to look beyond the immediate struggle and trust in a higher purpose. As long as we do not question our physical reality, we are like a chicken inside an egg – confined, limited, and unaware of the vast world beyond. This is why the tip of our staff must be sharp, like an egg tooth. It represents the piercing question: “Is serving better than ruling?”. This question is the first step on our journey back to Heaven, and it demands a clear and resounding “yes*”. Without this commitment, we cannot begin to break free from the shell of our limited existence. Yet, even with this intent, history shows how easily the path of service can be twisted into one of domination. The heavenly recommendations given through Moses were rooted in service, but the demons of that time distorted them so quickly into harsh, ruling commandments that they barely touched the ground before being corrupted. This is what happens when we try to pour heavenly water into a mind filled with demonic waste – the result is nothing but stinking sewage. Therefore, to continue our journey to Heaven, we must first cleanse our minds. Better yet, we must empty them entirely. Do not attempt to mix the heavenly Spirit with old, demonic ways – it will only make things worse. Only with a pure and open heart can we truly receive the light of Heaven and walk the path of service that leads us home.
