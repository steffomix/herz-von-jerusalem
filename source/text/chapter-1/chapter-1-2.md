## Second Bowl: Humbleness

Onward to the second bowl of groundedness through humbleness. On the staff, it's the second verse, or the first verse on the second day, and it reads: “Always try to be the least.”. On our flute, it's the first hole for the deepest note. This staff is here like a sword that cuts away all pride and honor. It's like a slag separator, separating the worthless from the valuable. Whoever wants to walk the path to heaven must be ready to lay down his pride. For the more the creativity and creative power of the heavenly spirit is expressed in and through us, the more humbleness is needed as a counterbalance. Humbleness is the rock, the solid ground upon which heaven is built and its angels are correspondingly steadfastly humble. For demons, on the other hand, who have absorbed the seductive greatness of heaven and are, in the truest sense, intertwined with it, humbleness is like a downright deadly, bitter, absolutely despicable poison. Therefore, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a proud honorable demon to enter heaven. And nothing fills an honorable demon with more pride and makes him richer and more powerful than ruling over dutiful, humble angels.
