## Fourth bowl: Graciousness

With the fourth bowl, our staff transforms into a flower, and we find the words: "Always try to be gracious, even where you want to close your heart.".

On our flute, this corresponds to the third hole - a note that marks the transition from recovering our heavenly spirit to expressing it.  

Here, we angels, who embody and express our heavenly spirit, collide with demons who mimic it. Demons seek recognition for their superficial good deeds, and those who receive their blessings often feel used - reduced to mere objects that allow the demons to shine and pride themselves on being "good."  

We angels, in our humility, seek no honor or recognition. We do not even wish to be noticed. For us, the greatest joy and honor is to let Godâ€™s heavenly spirit flow through us.  

Yet, this angelic flower state is fragile. Many of us are consumed, trampled, or trapped in mental or emotional prisons. Some are buried beneath the waste of religious conformity, while others become ornaments on the graves of their demonic commanders - decorations for the evil systems that destroyed them, only to later be displayed as symbols of false holiness.

To open ourselves and reveal our heavenly beauty in a demonic environment is profoundly challenging. Many angels literally disappear, their journeys ending here. On our flute, this is symbolized by the gap between the third and fourth holes - a dark time of torment, suffering, and abuse. Only the strongest, toughest, and those with extraordinary healing abilities can endure this and move forward to face even greater challenges.
