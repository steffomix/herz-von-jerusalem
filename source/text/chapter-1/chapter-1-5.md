## Fifth bowl: Love anyway

Let us now move to the fifth bowl – the bowl of the brave mountaineer. Here, our staff transforms into a hiking staff, and we find the words: “Always try to love where no love is.”. This reminds us that when life becomes easy, we are likely on the wrong path, descending rather than ascending.  

On our flute, this is represented by the fourth hole - a tone that opens a new perspective. Suddenly, everything that once sought to bring us down, to harm us, becomes an opportunity to strengthen our heavenly Spirit and grow in love.  

A demon enslaves us? Thank you - we become even more servant-hearted.  
A demon honors us? Thank you - we learn to remain humble.  
A demon mortifies us? Thank you - we are freed from pride.  
A demon hurts us? Thank you - we learn to forgive even more deeply.  
A demon traps us in a toxic relationship? Thank you - we connect more profoundly with our inner source of healing.  

In this way, every act of demonic abuse only amplifies the light we emit - the true light that reveals the nature of both angels and demons. This is the light that demons lack and can only reflect. It is the light that exposes why demons avoid dirt and cling to their polished, shiny exteriors. 

The disgusting mood and filth demons throw at us, may dim our angelic light temporarily, but it also increases the heat of our love until all the dirt returns as molten lava of forced repentance into the hide of the demon's dark existence.  

With every difficult step we take up the mountain of God’s heavenly Spirit, we experience more of His true glory. It flows through us like a river of pure bliss and tranquility, filling us with a sense of divine connection and purpose.  

But the higher we climb, the brighter our light and the hotter our love becomes. As Heaven’s beauty is revealed in its fullness, so too are the depths of darkness in the demons’ reality. The contrast can be overwhelming – breathtaking revelations often demand a pause, a moment of rest to digest the vastness of God’s kingdom and the freedom we have to either accept or reject His Spirit, along with the life and challenges it brings.
