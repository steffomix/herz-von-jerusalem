## Sixth Bowl - holy heavenly spirit

With the fifth and final hole of our flute, we not only remember the power of love and what it means to truly love but also realize that love is our most valuable treasure, surpassing even the most brilliant intellect.  

Here, our staff transforms into a fiery sword of power, its mystic symbols glowing with ancient wisdom - a weapon grasped only by those who have faced and defeated the monstrous horrors of the abyss.  

The sixth bowl carries the message: “Always let love be your most precious treasure.”.  

Love exists outside of time, free from the burdens of past judgments and future expectations. While our mind lingers in uncertainty, love moves with confidence and clarity.  

Heavenly love is a one-pot stew of selfless service, rock-bottom humbleness, unconditional forgiveness, and gratitude without expectations. With its service, love moves through the demons' dominion like vital oil in a gearbox. With humbleness, it softens their aggressive raids. With forgiveness, it becomes invulnerable. With graciousness, it becomes inexhaustible. And because the only reason for love is love itself, it becomes an invincible warrior that stops for nothing.  

Just as every soup has its own aroma, reflecting its ingredients, so too do angels and demons have their own “smell” “ an intensely powerful essence that reveals their nature. For angels, this essence is a radiant, overwhelming fragrance of purity and love. For demons, it is a suffocating stench of decay and pride. With the legendary power of love, we angels conquer the demons' dominion of the mind and tame it into a tool to express our heavenly Spirit. And the first task for this tamed tool is this. Silence yourself, stand firm, and listen deeply!:  

Demons, too, stop at nothing to claim the angels' most precious treasures. They repackaged the angels' spiritual essence - the “smell” that reflects their humble servant tendency to act - into something called “karma”, binding souls to an endless cycle of guilt. To deepen the deception, they painted the demonic abuse as a divine trial, a sacred duty to serve them for a redemption that would never come.  

We all face trouble at times and need support to move forward. But while angels seek only enough support to stand on their own again, demons grow dependent, demanding endless assistance. 
Demons are good in only the two talents of a parasite and a freeloader: A parasite is someone who enters or takes possession of someone else's property and behaves as if it belongs to them. A freeloader is someone who expects - or even demands - the maximum possible reward for the minimal possible effort. And what both have in common is that they define their greatness by how many obedient servants rush to their aid, even for the smallest of problems.
This abuse of the heavenly spirit makes demons even worse and we angels have to face the sad truth, that we can not help and need to turn our back on them.
