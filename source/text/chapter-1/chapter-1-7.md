Seventh Bowl - God's voice

In the seventh and final bowl, we remember the beauty and purity of our heavenly spirit - preserved and kept holy through all hardships endured on our ascent to the mountain's peak. Now, with all holes of our flute open and free, we angels can use this sacred instrument to express and discover the profound depths of our divine inner connection.

Playing this flute becomes a meditation of self-reflection, realigning us with our heavenly essence. As we sound each note, we retrace our path to heaven's summit, remembering our angelic roots. Just as flowers draw nourishment from their roots, this path to the peak represents the very root of our celestial origin - our heavenly family. When we play with true devotion to our divine connection, we become conduits for God's true voice, the heavenly spirit flowing through us.

We angels are living expressions of God's spirit. Yet the moment we use this instrument to impress others or manipulate our environment, we step onto the demonic descent to hell. Thus the inscription running along our flute reminds us: “Always protect and connect your humble loving heart with forgiveness.”

The sensitivity and power of this flute's music must never be underestimated.

On the demonic path, music becomes a weapon - its power abused to push and manipulate others into foreign states of being. Success in such manipulation breeds the toxic sensations of superiority and pride. Thus emerge deceivers, those enchanted by deception, and those who follow illusions before the heavenly spirit. This abuse of music marks the beginning of demonic control.

The true turning point from angel to demon comes when we seek to impress with our expressions, or become more enthralled by external displays than our inner divine light. In its beautiful simplicity, the flute serves as a divine mirror - revealing whether we've strayed into darkness.

When we feel unconfident in our playing or doubt our skill, these are demonic whispers trying to suppress our need for divine expression. 

Demons have fallen prey to their own impressive but hollow creations, burying their divine connection beneath layers of artifice. Without the anchor of heavenly spirit, they desperately cling to music and other impressive displays as artificial anchors for their unstable existence.

The seventh inscription on our staff holds mysteries too profound for words alone. It bears the true and unutterable name of God, represented as seven mirrors encircling the staff. It proclaims: “Seek God in these seven mirrors to love, to love, and again to love, more than anything in the world, more than anything measurable and more than your live.”. Here, “the world” means all expressions; “measurable” warns against comparison; and “live” signifies our worldly identity.
