## FLooking back the path:

Angels of heaven, be aware that demons will always try to mimic the heavenly spirit in order to sneak into the heavenly realm and also try to pull you back into their demonic reality. And they do it always the way it is written on the staff.

First they try to entertain you to shift your awareness away from your inner divine source.

Then they try to praise you to lift you away from your solid ground of humbleness.

Once pride begins to sneaks into you and make you feel entitled to be something better, your ability to forgive will sneak away and you will become judgmental.

Once you have become judgmental, your angelique strength of a gentle heart will be weakened. And your weakened heart will build up walls for protection. And your locked up heart behind walls will lock up your graciousness also.

Once you have begun to build up walls, you have crossed to point of no return, so that every challenge that would strengthen your heavenly spirit otherwise, will lead you to build even more walls and become even more judgmental.

Once your walls have locked up your heart completely, the Walls will act on its own and you will appear as if you have no soul, no spirit, no love. You will behave like beast, react solely on the physical outside and act only for physical outside needs and instincts.

Once you have become a beast, you have reached a special kind of death and you - or your walls - will not be able anymore to grasp the concept of spirit and you will only be able to mimic a living soul. And where the self of a living soul deeply reflects his inner spirit and divine connection, you will only paint and decorate your grave of your starved and locked soul with an up to pyramidal temple of commandments, that require ever more laws and orders to cover the stench of your desperate and bitter rotting soul, that wants to break through all of its shell, its grave.
