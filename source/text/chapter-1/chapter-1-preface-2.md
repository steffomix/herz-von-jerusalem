## Remember Heaven

Angels of heaven, remember the place where every heart beats in harmony with the Divine Source. A place where every thought, word, and action is an expression of pure love – not for self, but for the joy of uplifting all beings. This is the essence of Heaven. Here, humbleness is our strength, the foundation that connects us to the grand tapestry of creation. We are not separate from the Divine but woven into its very fabric. Pride, that whisper which seeks to elevate the self, has no place here. In Heaven, our worth is measured not by worldly achievements but by the depth of our love, the breadth of our compassion, and the selfless service we offer. Forgiveness is not a burden but a liberation. It releases the chains of resentment and opens our hearts to healing. Judgment has no place here, for every soul is a unique spark of the Divine, deserving of love and compassion, no matter their past. Grace flows freely in Heaven, a river of pure, unearned love. It is not something to be earned but a gift given simply because we exist. Mercy, as the world knows it, is unnecessary here, for there is no punishment – only the constant invitation to return to the heavenly Spirit. Love is the cornerstone of Heaven. It is not just a feeling but a way of being. It is expressed through kindness, forgiveness, and selfless service. Challenges here are not obstacles but opportunities to grow, to deepen our connection to the Divine, and to reveal our true nature. But remember, the path to Heaven begins within. It starts with transforming your heart – releasing pride, judgment, and resentment, and embracing humbleness, forgiveness, and graciousness. For as within, so without. Guard your heart, for the choices you make today shape your eternal journey.
