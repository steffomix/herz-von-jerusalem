## The fall of the angels

Long ago, the angels were born as unique shards of God, the One. Created to express the Divine Spirit in their own beautiful ways, their combined expressions became what we know as Heaven. Heaven was the radiant reflection of God’s heavenly Spirit – a place of overwhelming beauty and harmony.  But over time, something shifted. The angels began to fall in love with their own creations, their own expressions. This love, though pure in its essence, became a distraction. It was as if they were cheating on their first love – the Divine Spirit itself. They consumed their creations, becoming one with them, and in doing so, they experienced something entirely new: pride. Pride was a sensation they had never known before, a sensation God had withheld from them for a reason they would soon discover – the hard way. Intoxicated by this new feeling, they began to curse God for keeping it from them. Their sense of self-worth shifted from their inner divine spirit to their outer creations. Their works became more important to them than their connection to the Source. But pride, as they would learn, is a fleeting sensation. As their heavenly bliss faded, they were left feeling empty and miserable. Yet, instead of admitting their error and letting go of their toxic desires, they clung to their pride even tighter. They began to seduce other angels, drawing them into their new reality, not just to follow their ways but to serve and praise them. They sought honor, recognition, and goods that would feed their addiction to pride, distracting them from the inner void that now consumed them. These seductive, once-heavenly beings became the first demons – empty, pride-addicted, and wicked remnants of what were once brilliant sparks of God’s beautiful Spirit.
