## Rescue attempts

Throughout history, heavenly angels have dared to cross into this toxic reality to remind the fallen of their origin. But their missions often ended in tragedy. Some became like the fallen, others were horribly executed as a warning, and some had their messages twisted to serve the demons’ purposes. For example, there was an angel who tried two times to break through the veil of this corrupted reality. The first attempt was through Moses. But the demons twisted his message into the harsh, punitive laws we know today – a far cry from the divine truth he originally brought. The second attempt was through Jesus. His message of love and unity was met with brutal rejection. The demons not only crucified him but also twisted his sacrifice into a distorted narrative of punishment and conquest, using it to justify centuries of oppression. Now, we are witnessing the third attempt – this very moment. This may sound harsh, but it is a necessary truth. Just as there are countless ways to express the beauty of God’s heavenly Spirit, there are also countless ways to reject it. And this is why I said at the beginning: There will be much to forgive, much to let go, but also much to remember and embrace. So, angels of heaven, brace your hearts. We are about to switch on a light like never before – and yes, it will be a tough ride. But together, we will reclaim what was lost.
