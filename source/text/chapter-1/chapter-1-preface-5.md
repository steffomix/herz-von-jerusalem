## Ein Stab wie eine Blume aus sieben Schalen und eine Flöte

In this final section before we begin, I want to describe the structure of the message itself. It is a multidimensional, layered revelation, expressed through symbolic objects that serve as parables. These objects are not just metaphors – they are expressions of the heavenly Spirit we are trying to convey, even because words alone cannot fully capture its essence. With each section, the light will grow brighter and brighter. The spiritual meaning of the objects will become clearer, deeper, and more multidimensional – rich with layers of interpretation. At the same time, you are invited to reflect on how much of yourself you recognize in these layers. There may come a point where the light becomes too bright, too intense, and you feel the need to step back. This point of "stepping back" is also your place in Heaven – provided you haven’t already stepped away at the first section or even long before. The first object is a staff, which is actually a stripped tree trunk. Its bare wood is marked with seven small verses, burned into it with the ink of fiery repentance. These seven verses are divided into three days, each representing one of the three appearances of the same angel we mentioned earlier. One section for the first angel, five for the second, and one for the third. But these seven sections also represent seven stacked bowls, which we fill with meaning and then pour out as we recognize their contents. Here, we begin to see the first dimensions of the multidimensional meanings we spoke of. The second object is a traditional five-hole flute, also divided into three sections or days. The first section, or the first angel, is represented by the fundamental tone when all five holes are closed. In the second section, the second angel opens the five holes, describing the path to Heaven. The third section, or the third angel, is represented by the heavenly melody or music that can be played on this flute. Additionally, the flute bears an engraved verse that represents a special aspect of Heaven, which will be revealed as we progress through the days. This journey will be intense – bright, hot, and profound. For those who have rejected, trampled, or even abused the heavenly Spirit for their own gain or glory, there will be much to repent. But for the angels of Heaven, this will be a moment of profound relief and recognition. They will see their origin, their home, like an old friend they haven’t seen in eternity. So, prepare your hearts, for the light is about to shine brighter than ever before.
