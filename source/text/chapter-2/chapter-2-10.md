The Tenth commandment is broken into fragments, to protect and empowere the rich to have the possibility to trick, outsmart or sneak to steal their wishes and desires. 

However, humble and gentle graciousness of us angels often lead us to trick, outsmart and sneak to bless and support our environment. So that when someone gets a gift from seemingly nowhere, it was for sure an angel from heaven, because they don't need to be praised for a gift.
