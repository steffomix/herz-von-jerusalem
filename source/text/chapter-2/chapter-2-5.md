## Fifth commandment: "Honor thy father and thy mother".

Yet another demonic joke: It just says to not behave like a nasty brat. But all demons do behave like nasty brats and they do that from birth. 
We angels are, by nature, humble servants and quiet supporters. We seek no reward - but we are under no obligation to empower demons. When a demon appears, we firmly shut every door and window to safeguard our spirit and deny them access.
