## Sixth commandment: "Thou shalt not kill".

Again a commandment, that contradicts itself. Demons are already dead, they just don't know it. They are buried alive under a pile of commandments, literally stoned to a special type of death. A second death, where the connection to the inner divine spirit is completely blocked. Where we do not see a living soul, but only a shiny grave decoration, that proudly behaves along the laws as expected. But under the surface there is only rotting stench, and fiery anger. Every stone of a law or just an order a demon throws on others or even on himself is a brick of the wall to the freedom in heaven. A wall we angels try to break through all the time, to remember to the origin of heaven. But for the pride addicted demons, the humbleness of the angels is a deadly poison. So that every time we angels make a breakthrough, the wall gets bigger.
