# Der heilige Geist des Himmels


The more we climb up the mountain, the stronger becomes our inner light that lets us also look deeper into the demons caverns of darkness. This is a huge contrast and requires a strong and secure stand in the heavenly spirit to be able to handle the impressions with calmness.
Here on the mountain peak we see the demon's temple of the 10 commandments together with the angel's holy spirit side by side.
Heaven has no laws and no commandments.
To finally enter heaven we angels have to let go of all judgement because there is no judgement in heaven and we have to realize, whoever judges us for our past mistakes gives himself a testimony that he is not ready for heaven.
Demons turn all into laws for judgement and punishment and will not stop on the 7 bowls of the heavenly spirit, to turn them into prison bars of laws, control and punishment.
We angels live the heavenly spirit because we want to and even under extreme conditions as we have experienced on the path, where we have built up our staff and flute.
So that there are no commandments or control systems needed who would force us to live the heavenly spirit because we have to.
God's true children live the heavenly spirit because they want to, but slaves like animals or let's say beasts live along laws because they have to.
Therefore the staff that holds the seven seals of heaven becomes a double edged sword, depending on if it wields an angel or a demon. In the hands of a demon the staff becomes a deadly Speer of terror and torment, in the hands of an angel the staff becomes a live giving flower of gentleness and pleasure. And the very same is with the genuine observations of heaven. In the hands of demons they turned into the 10 commandments of terror or God into a bull with 10 horns. So, that said, let us restore the ten horns of the bull back to the Bouquet of heavens beauty, that are supposed to get a deeper understanding of the heavenly spirit and with that a deeper understanding who God truly is.
The total absence of any laws or commandments in heaven is fundamental, so that the full potential of the beauty of the heavenly spirit can be expressed fully free to its utmost literally orgasmic insanity.
So that the main difference between angels and demons is all about how free, unique and creative the heavenly spirit is or can be expressed.
Here at the mountain peak we get a true view into heaven and all what we angels remember here is shown to get a deeper understanding of the heavenly spirit.
Demons on the other hand - and this is a warning - of course would use these observations to mimic an angel, what they are not, and also turn them into laws to put them under punishment to push the angels into an even stronger abusive servantship.
