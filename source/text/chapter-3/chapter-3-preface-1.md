Prelude

Angels of heaven, brace yourself - the journey ahead is vast, profound, and yes, it will be challenging. This is not just a return; this is a reclamation. We are stepping into the Great Shift, breaking through the physical veil, rising from the depths to the heights of our heavenly origin. With the pure tools of love, truth, and light, we will reclaim what has always been ours. The light of truth will not only awaken our memories of heaven but also reveal the shadows we are ready to leave behind. So prepare your hearts, dear angels, for there is much to forgive, much to release, but even more to remember and embrace. The time has come to rise, to shine, and to reclaim our home.
